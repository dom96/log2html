# log2html
log2html gathers useful information about all the requests that have been processed by a HTTP server. It does this by parsing a `access.log` file which is generated by the HTTP software.

## Compiling
To compile log2html you will need the latest Nimrod compiler which can be found [here](http://github.com/Araq/Nimrod/ "nimrod"). Log2html relies on the very latest changes to Nimrod so using the latest version from the Github repository would be wise.

Once you have a working Nimrod compiler you can compile log2html with: `nimrod c -d:release log2html`

## Usage
Just execute *log2html* with the path to the access.log file. For example: `log2html access.log`. An `output.html` file will then be created in the current directory.
